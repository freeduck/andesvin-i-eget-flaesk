Unknown: She used to be great. She's still very beautiful.

Trump: I moved on her and I failed. I'll admit it. 

Trump: I did try and fuck her. She was married.

Unknown: That's huge news.

Trump: No, no, Nancy. No this was — and I moved on her very heavily, in fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said I'll show you where they have some nice furniture. I took her out furniture. I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there, and she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony tits and everything. She's totally changed her look.

Bush: Sheesh, your girl's hot as shit. In the purple.

Various: Whoa! Yes! Whoa!

Bush: Yes! The Donald has scored. Whoa, my man!

Trump: Look at you. You are a pussy.

Trump: Maybe it's a different one.

Bush: It better not be the publicist. No, it's her. It's —

Trump: Yeah, that's her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything.

Bush: Whatever you want.

Trump: Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.

Bush: Yeah those legs, all I can see is the legs.

Trump: Oh, it looks good.

Bush: Come on, shorty.

Trump: Oh, nice legs, huh?

Bush: Oof, get out of the way, honey. Oh, that's good legs. Go ahead.

Trump: It's always good if you don't fall out of the bus. Like Ford, Gerald Ford, remember?

Bush: Down below. Pull the handle.

Trump: Hello, how are you, hi.

Arianne Zucker: Hi Mr. Trump. How are you?

Trump: Nice seeing you. Terrific, terrific. You know Billy Bush?

Bush: Hello, nice to see you. How you doing, Arianne?

Zucker: I'm doing very well, thank you. Are you ready to be a soap star?

Trump: We're ready, let's go. Make me a soap star.

Bush: How about a little hug for the Donald? He just got off the bus.

Zucker: Would you like a little hug, darling?

Trump: Absolutely. Melania said this was OK.

Bush: How about a little hug for the Bushy? I just got off the bus. Here we go. Excellent. Well you've got a nice co-star here.

Trump: Good. After you.

Trump: Come on, Billy, don't be shy.

Bush: Soon as a beautiful woman shows up he just, he takes off. This always happens.

Zucker: I'm sorry, come here.

Bush: Let the little guy in here, come on.

Zucker: Yeah, let the little guy in. How you feel now? Better? I should actually be in the middle.

Bush: It's hard to walk next to a guy like this. Yeah, you get in the middle. There we go.

Trump: Good. That's better.

Zucker: This is much better. This is —

Trump: That's better.

Bush: Now, if you had to choose honestly between one of us. Me or the Donald?

Trump: I don't know, that's tough competition.

Zucker: That's some pressure right there.

Bush: Seriously, you had to take one of us as a date.

Zucker: I have to take the Fifth on that one. Yep, I'll take both.

Trump: Which way?

Zucker: Make a right. Here we go.

Bush: Here he goes. I'm gonna leave you here. Give me my microphone.

Trump: OK. OK. Oh, you're finished?

Bush: You're my man. Yeah.

Trump: Oh, good.

Bush: I'm gonna go do our show.

Zucker: Oh, you want to reset? OK.
